The purpose of this project is to exercise basic JavaScript skills aquired through The ODIN Project.

Project Goals:
- Build a rock, paper, scissors game in JavaScript from scatch.
- Write logic to get a human and computer choice from the string values ("rock", "paper", or "scissors").
- Declare players score variables and keep track of the score.
- Write logic to play 5 rounds of the game entirely in the console and declare a winner at the end.

Secondary Goals:
- Create a feature branch and merge it into the main branch
- Re-work/re-factor the code to introduce a UI feature so the game will be played outside the console.
